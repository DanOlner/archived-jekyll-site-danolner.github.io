Yay! I've got myself [jekyll'd up](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and am [githubified](https://github.com/DanOlner) too. Like a lot of other people, I wish I'd got my noggin around git a little earlier - it would have helped the progress of the [PhD modelling](http://www.coveredinbees.org/node/431) framework no end. (At the moment, I'm keepin the PhD code over at bitbucket while I work out which bits might see the light of day.)

I'm in the process of getting various bits of code here; as I go on, we'll see whether blogging here as well is a worthwhile venture. [The other blog](http://www.coveredinbees.org)'s gone pretty quiet in the past few months - I'll probably go and write something navel-gazing over there about that. The idea, hopefully, of having somewhere else to blog that's sitting right next to my code (sort-of) is to keep me focused on the nitty-gritty a little bit more - perhaps avoid that navel-gazing I mentioned. Though there's bound to be some.

There are a few things I want to do while I'm here. As [this old post](http://www.geotalisman.org/2012/08/29/boxplot-x-ray-visualisation-processing/) discusses, I've had an interest in visualisation for a good while. This developed through the PhD too - it was partly through visualising and interacting with my agents in the model that I learned to understand its dynamics. It was fascinating to see the same process at work recently in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar: physicist Kip Thorne [gained new insights into the workings of black holes](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/) when Nolan's FX team used his maths to create a visualisation. He plans to get two papers off the back of the discovery.

I suspect I'm going to need to unhook my fingers from Java a little more than I've been willing (able?) to do up to now. Until relatively recently, it was still easy enough to showcase Java through applets on the web - [this has become increasingly impossible](http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/running-jar-with-unknown-publisher-blocked-in-future-java-release/30995/view.html). Java's still got plenty of life in it, of course - but it's not much use if you want to present via the web. 

I still plan to use it - for some of the things I'd like to do, its speed still wins. But for communicating? I have a feeling I'll need to shift to more native web technologies, and I'm currently feeling rather out of the loop with all that. Hopefully this blog will help me change that. Processing (the Java based graphics package I use a lot) does have an option for exporting as javascript ([here's an example](http://danolner.github.io/exploringchaos/) of one of mine running in the browser) but I'm a long way from feeling as comfortable with web development generally as I do with Java.

Nowt wrong with being outside yer comfort zone, though, eh? So let's see what happens...
